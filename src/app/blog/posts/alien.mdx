## Overview

Miro approached me to collaborate on recreating the iconic LV-426 space station from the 1979 film *Alien* and its spiritual successor, *Alien: Isolation*. The goal was ambitious: capture the oppressive, lived-in atmosphere of that claustrophobic environment while leveraging modern rendering techniques. Miro handled modeling and texturing, while I focused on the engine setup, shader architecture, and cinematography.

From the start, we committed to detailed reference work—studying the original cinematography, material language, and lighting design from Ridley Scott's film. The technical strategy centered on Unreal's Substrate system with RGB-masked materials to balance visual quality against performance constraints. This workflow became the foundation for almost everything we built.


## Challenges

Balancing period authenticity with modern rendering presented an ongoing tension. The exterior of the station was particularly tricky as reference material was sparse. Brad Wright's (Creative Assembly's Lead Concept Artist) ArtStation portfolio became invaluable, offering the few high-resolution exterior concepts we could source.

Tone was critical for me: the station needed to feel inhabited but abandoned, eerie without being obvious. This meant studying Ridley Scott's specific cinematography choices. The stillness, subtle movement, restraint, and translating that into camera work and scene composition was crucial. 

## Asset Development

I contributed a couple of hero props to the scene:

**Weylan-Yutani Aspen Beer Can**: I recreated the film accurate graphics in <Hi>Illustrator and Photoshop</Hi>, then modelled both high and low poly in <Hi>Blender</Hi>. Baking in <Hi>Marmoset Toolbag</Hi> captured the detail, and <Hi>Substance Painter</Hi> handled the final texturing.

**Robud**: Sourced from screenshots across the Alien games, I wanted to make a fun little asset to bring life to the scene. I built a mid-poly base in <Hi>Blender</Hi>, then created both high and low variants. For baking, I used the high-to-mid poly approach in Marmoset since both mid and low shared the same UVs, giving me better cage geometry and more accurate normal transfer.  


## Shader Architecture

Shaders occupied a significant portion of my effort. We started with Unreal's standard lit pipeline, but quickly migrated to Substrate for the higher visual fidelity ceiling it provided. This architectural shift enabled more complex material behavior without spiraling performance costs.

**Core Shaders Developed:**

**UV2 RGB Mask**: The workhorse material. Used across modular assets with packed color channels driving different material properties simultaneously.

**SDF Text**: Procedural text rendering without texture sheets, enabling readable signage at variable scales.

**Glass**: Layered dielectric approximation with chromatic dispersion and surface detail.

**Flow Decal**: Directional decal projection for practical effects like leaking fluids.

**Lamp**: Practical and emissive lights with color temperature variation.

**Bodybag Shader**: This was conceptually interesting. I posed a character from <Hi>Character Creator</Hi> in a corpse configuration, then fabricated the bodybag cloth in <Hi>Marvelous Designer</Hi>. After retopology in Blender (Quad Remesher for the low poly) and baking in Marmoset, I worked on the shader behavior.

The challenge: I didn't want the engine rendering translucent geometry on top of a full subsurface scattering shader, which is inefficient and visually messy. Instead, I baked the posed body (as high poly) onto the bodybag geometry, extracting height, color, and normal maps. In Photoshop, I used the heightmap to blend between base cloth color and interior body color, so the shader's subsurface scattering could realistically simulate how color dissipates through depth.



## Iteration & VFX

The scene evolved through multiple passes. Windows and ceiling received complete overhauls to better align with the original aesthetic and mood we were targeting.

I created a suite of visual effects to enhance key moments: dripping liquid with realistic splash dynamics, procedural SDF-based goo effects, and AC ventilation dust particle systems. Each added another layer of environmental storytelling. 

## Environment & Exterior

We initially planned to keep the station's exterior out of frame, but realized even a simple silhouette added crucial context and atmosphere. From reference imagery, I blocked out the external geometry, then densified it with kitbash library assets for better silhouettes.

I added signature red warning lights on masts (sourced from the original concepts) with a custom blinking shader excluded from temporal anti-aliasing to preserve fast pulse frequencies without smoothing artifacts.

A procedural scaffolding system in Blender's Geometry Nodes automated structural geometry: outline → parametric scaffolding. Similarly, a procedural pipe system generated piping networks efficiently across the hull.

**Window Treatment**: The concept art showed distinct window pattern variations, which I recreated and used to tile across interior walls. Initially they felt flat and lifeless in-engine. So I built a small environment scene with modular wall sections and windows, performed a cubemap capture (360° interior), then created a rotation-randomized interior cubemap shader for the windows.

I added a Geometry Nodes pass that randomizes vertex color per window, using the R channel to modulate emissive intensity and the G channel to shift blackbody temperature. This created subtle per-window variation without flatness, while staying performant through ultra-low cubemap resolution.



## Cinematography & Camera Work

I spent considerable time recreating the cinematographic language of the original film. It was a deliberate constraint that elevated the visual consistency.

**Filmstock & Format**: I configured the camera to match the 35mm Kodak Eastman 100T 5247 filmstock used in the 1979 shoot, with a filmback that ensured accurate aspect ratio when re-squeezed from anamorphic lensing.

**Lenses**: The Panavision C-Series lenses recreated the original filming. Using tiedtke's comprehensive anamorphic lenses pack (https://tiedtke.gumroad.com/l/realcinemalenses), I configured Unreal's lens component and tuned optical imperfections: chromatic aberration, purple fringing, vignetting, and focus falloff to match the real optics.

**Motion & Composition**: Ridley Scott's cinematography relied on sparse, deliberate movement with still shots with minimal animation to create unease without feeling static. I replicated this through:

- **Rail Rigs**: Implemented via Unreal's Cine Rig Rails system with manual Sequencer keyframing
- **Handheld Motion**: Captured real camera movement and shake using Unreal's V-Cam with my phone as the input device, lending organic imperfection
- **Layered Shake**: For scenes where V-Cam alone couldn't achieve the desired feel, I layered Perlin noise for organic randomness with sinusoidal breathing motion to simulate a handheld rig
- **Locker POV**: I experimented with confined camera work—simulating how a player experiences *Alien: Isolation* from inside a locker. V-Cam captured the claustrophobic shake and gave the motion tactile authenticity
