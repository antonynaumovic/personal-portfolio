## Planning
In the beginning stages of the project, Miro brought me on board to assist with the recreation of the iconic space station from the movie Alien and game Alien: Isolation. 
Our initial focus was on planning the project scope and dividing responsibilities. Miro took charge of the modelling and texturing aspects, while I concentrated on setting up the Unreal Engine environment, shaders, and lighting.
we focused on gathering reference material from the original movie to ensure accuracy in our recreation. 
We analyzed the lighting, textures, and overall atmosphere of the space station to capture its eerie and claustrophobic feel.
I researched the real cinematography techniques used in the film to better understand how to replicate the lighting and mood in Unreal Engine.

We also decided on the technical requirements for the project, including the shader workflow, which we ended up deciding to use RGB Masked materials for most assets to optimize performance while maintaining visual fidelity.
