## Planning
In the beginning stages of the project, Miro brought me on board to assist with the recreation of the iconic space station from the movie Alien and game Alien: Isolation. 
Our initial focus was on planning the project scope and dividing responsibilities. Miro took charge of the modelling and texturing aspects, while I concentrated on setting up the Unreal Engine environment, shaders, and lighting.
we focused on gathering reference material from the original movie to ensure accuracy in our recreation. 
We analyzed the lighting, textures, and overall atmosphere of the space station to capture its eerie and claustrophobic feel.
I researched the real cinematography techniques used in the film to better understand how to replicate the lighting and mood in Unreal Engine.

We also decided on the technical requirements for the project, including the shader workflow, which we ended up deciding to use RGB Masked materials for most assets to optimize performance while maintaining visual fidelity.


## Challenges

Some challenges we faced in this project were: finding ways to make the visuals look like the original movie but with a modern take. I also had to find reference for the outside of the station, which there was only one place that I found high resolution renders of the sides I needed, which was Brad Wright's (Creative Assembly Lead Concept Artist) ArtStation, where he had posted concepts of the station. 

We also wanted the station to feel lived-in, yet desolate to portray an uneasy feeling and mimic some of the techniques of the 1979 film. 

## Modelling
I made a couple of props for the scene too, the Weylan-Yutani (later Weyland-Yutani) Aspen Beer,  where I recreated the graphics in Illustrator and Photoshop, modelled the high and low poly in Blender, baked in Marmoset Toolbag, and textured in Substance Painter. 

The robot, which I nicknamed Robud, I modelled in Blender from screenshots I found in-game, I modelled the mid poly in Blender, then from that I created a low poly and high poly. I baked from the high to mid poly in Marmoset Toolbag to get a better cage and bake since it shared the UVs with the low poly. I then textured the asset in Substance Painter.
