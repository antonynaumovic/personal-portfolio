## Planning
In the beginning stages of the project, Miro brought me on board to assist with the recreation of the iconic space station from the movie Alien and game Alien: Isolation. 
Our initial focus was on planning the project scope and dividing responsibilities. Miro took charge of the modelling and texturing aspects, while I concentrated on setting up the Unreal Engine environment, shaders, and lighting.
we focused on gathering reference material from the original movie to ensure accuracy in our recreation. 
We analyzed the lighting, textures, and overall atmosphere of the space station to capture its eerie and claustrophobic feel.
I researched the real cinematography techniques used in the film to better understand how to replicate the lighting and mood in Unreal Engine.

We also decided on the technical requirements for the project, including the shader workflow, which we ended up deciding to use RGB Masked materials for most assets to optimize performance while maintaining visual fidelity.


## Challenges

Some challenges we faced in this project were: finding ways to make the visuals look like the original movie but with a modern take. I also had to find reference for the outside of the station, which there was only one place that I found high resolution renders of the sides I needed, which was Brad Wright's (Creative Assembly Lead Concept Artist) ArtStation, where he had posted concepts of the station. 

We also wanted the station to feel lived-in, yet desolate to portray an uneasy feeling and mimic some of the techniques of the 1979 film. 

## Modelling
I made a couple of props for the scene too, the Weylan-Yutani (later Weyland-Yutani) Aspen Beer,  where I recreated the graphics in Illustrator and Photoshop, modelled the high and low poly in Blender, baked in Marmoset Toolbag, and textured in Substance Painter. 

The robot, which I nicknamed Robud, I modelled in Blender from screenshots I found in-game, I modelled the mid poly in Blender, then from that I created a low poly and high poly. I baked from the high to mid poly in Marmoset Toolbag to get a better cage and bake since it shared the UVs with the low poly. I then textured the asset in Substance Painter. 


## Shaders

A large portion of my time in this project comprised of making shaders.

In the beginning of the project, we were using Unreal's default lit pipeline, but we switched over to Substrate so we had a higher ceiling for quality.

The shaders that I created were:

UV2 RGB Mask shader:

SDF Text shader:

Glass shader:

Flow decal shader:

Lamp shader:

Bodybag shader:
For the Bodybag shader, I started off by posing a character from Character Creator into a corpse pose,
then using it to create a bodybag in Marvelous Designer. After, I retopologised in Blender using Quad Remesher for the low poly, baked them using Marmoset Toolbag, and textured them in Substance Painter.

I didn't want to have the engine rendering a translucent material on top of a subsurface scattering shader, so I thought I could fake the interior scattering of the
body in-shader.

In Marmoset, I used the posed body as the high poly and baked it onto the low poly, which gave me the height, colour, and normal for the interior.
I used the heightmap in Photoshop to blend between the base colour of the bodybag and the body, so the subsurface scattering of the shader would accurately reflect how the colour
would dissipate based on depth.



## Experimentation

The scene went through several revisions, including a complete redo of the windows and ceiling to better match the original vision
we had.

I also created multiple different types of VFX to help add to some shots, this included: dripping liquid with splashing, SDF goo, and AC dust particles. 

## Environment

Originally, we weren't going to have the outside of the station visible, but found that it added a lot with even just a basic blockout of the station visible.
From gathered reference images, I created a blockout of the station, and then used my kitbash library to add extra details to the silhouette.
I added red and white lights on masts like seen in the original concepts and created a blinking light shader that is excluded from temporal effects
so that it can pulse quickly without being smoothed.
I also created a procedural, low poly scaffolding system in Blender's Geometry nodes that takes the outline of a shape and turns it into scaffolding. 
As well, I created a procedural pipe system using Geometry Nodes to quickly add piping across the station.

For the windows, I found in the concept art that there were a few variations of window patterns, so I recreated those and used them to fill in the walls.
In the engine, the windows felt a little bit flat, so I created a scene with a few of the modular walls and windows, then set up a cubemap capture to create a
360 cubemap of the room. I then created a rotation-randomised interior cubemap shader to put on the windows. I created a quick geometry nodes setup that gave each window
a randomised vertex colour and used the R channel to lerp the emissive intensity, and the G channel to lerp the blackbody temperature so each of the windows had a unique feel.

I found this added a bit more variety to the windows as it meant it wasn't just a flat colour. I kept this performant by using an ultra-low resolution for the cubemap.



## Lighting and Rendering

I also spent some time setting up lighting and realistic rendering scenarios for the scene.

### Cinematography
I recreated the same cameras and lenses that were used in the original 1979 film.

#### Camera
I used a camera with a filmback that matched the 35mm Kodak Eastman 100T 5247 film that was used
in the film, this allowed the aspect ratio to be accurate when re-stretched from the anamorphic lens.

#### Lenses
I recreated the Panavision C-Series lenses used in the majority of filming within the film with large help from 
tiedtke's anamorphic lenses pack: https://tiedtke.gumroad.com/l/realcinemalenses. I used these with the Unreal lens component
and then adjusted the chromatic aberration, purple fringing, vignetting, and lens sharpness to match the output of the real
lenses.

#### Motion
I researched some of the cinematography techniques used to establish the atmosphere within the first movie,
and found several techniques that I incorporated into my production, this included very still shots with only one or two elements moving
to bring an uneasy sense of stillness yet not having it lifeless.

They also used rail rigs in the original, which I implemented using Unreal's Cine Rig Rails and keyframed the position manually with sequencer.
I also used Unreal's V-Cam with my phone to capture camera rotation and shake to add to the realism of the shots.
For scenes where I couldn't get the desired look with just my phone, I created layered camera shake using perlin noise for randomness and a sinusoidal noise for where there'd be breathing using a handheld rig.


I wanted to experiment too using a handheld rig inside of a locker to emulate how a player would be inside of Alien: Isolation.
I used my phone with V-Cam to emulate this look and it allowed me to capture real shakiness and feeling through the motion.
