## Overview

Back in 2020, I wanted to dive deep into how materials age and how to represent that in 3D. 
I chose the Aiwa AD-1800 Cassette Deck to explore anisotropic shading and multi-layered texture workflows. 

The challenge was capturing the lived-in feeling: how vintage hifi equipment ages and develops wear that tells a story.

## Reference & Topology

I gathered references from eBay listings, service manuals, and vintage product photography. The challenge was filling in gaps where documentation didn't exist. I leaned on materials science and manufacturing techniques to inform how these surfaces would realistically degrade over years of use.

I also planned the topology with animation in mind. The VU meter needles needed to be separate, riggable objects so I could drive them with audio-reactive bone drivers. The memory counter became a rotating cylinder with mapped numerals, letting me animate it to whichever position I wanted.


## Modeling & Texturing

I started with <Hi>Blender</Hi>, blocking out shapes with cubes and refining them using booleans and bevels for the clean, 70's aesthetic. Then I baked high-poly to low-poly in <Hi>Marmoset Toolbag</Hi> and brought everything into <Hi>Substance Painter</Hi>.

For the texturing, I approached it in distinct passes, building surface character layer by layer:

1. **Base materials**: Brushed aluminium, injection-moulded plastics, anodised accents - the untouched factory finish.
2. **Wear & patina**: Discolouration, sticker damage, accumulated debris, oxidation
3. **Micro details**: Scratches, dust settling into surfaces, subtle colour shifts from weathering

I also added procedural hair and dust particles using Blender's spline modelling and particle systems. These will be small volumetric elements that sell the "lived-in" aesthetic.


## Materials & Lighting

Lighting combined an HDRI of a well-lit room with directional fill and key lights. The materials are where things got interesting—each surface needed its own approach:

- **Brushed Aluminium**: Anisotropic specular with texture-driven direction and roughness variation, so light travels along the grain
- **Plastic Housing**: Clearcoat layering to simulate how the original finish degrades and loses that glossy factory look
- **Acrylic Panel**: Subsurface scattering to capture the hazy, milky quality that builds up from repeated handling and wear
- **Dust & Hair**: Volumetric hair shader with anisotropic highlights and SSS to feel organic and light-scattered

I rendered using ray-traced global illumination in ACES colour space. For animation, I set up bone drivers in Blender that respond to audio input—the VU needles sync to the audio, and the counter spins accordingly. It ties the whole thing together.
