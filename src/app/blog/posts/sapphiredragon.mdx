## Planning

For the project, I started out by gathering reference images and concept art of the dragon to understand its design and details. 
I also looked through the DnD Wiki to find any additional information about the dragon's appearance and characteristics that could help inform my modelling and texturing process.
I found that the dragon is described as having a crystalline, gem-like appearance, which inspired me to focus on creating a shader that could capture the unique look of the dragon's skin and scales.

The dragon is also described as being territorial, cunning, and having a psionic nature. This influenced my decision to give the dragon a sleek and menacing look, with sharp, angular features and a dark, iridescent colour palette.

I also researched Unreal Engine 5's Substrate material system to see how I could leverage it to achieve the desired look for the dragon's skin and scales.

I created a PureRef board to organise my reference images and keep them easily accessible throughout the project. This helped me stay focused on the key design elements and ensure that I was capturing the essence of the dragon's appearance in my work.

## Modelling

I started this project by using a skeleton 3D model of a human figure, which I found from [AnatomyTool]("https://anatomytool.org/open3dmodel" "AnatomyTool Website"), as a base for the dragon's body. 
I chose this approach to get a realistic and anatomically correct structure for the dragon. I then blocked out a rough muscle structure on top of the skeleton to establish the overall shape and proportions of the dragon's body.

I researched various dragon anatomy and musculature to inform my modelling process, looking at both real-world animals and fantasy art to understand how the muscles would flow and connect on the dragon's body.
I paid close attention to the reference images and concept art to ensure that I was capturing the unique features of the dragon, such as its long neck, powerful limbs, and large wings.


I used the side and top view reference images to create a rough blockout of the dragon's body, focusing on capturing the overall shape and proportions of the creature. 
I then added more detail to the model, sculpting the scales individually to create their flowing, organic shapes. 
I paid close attention to the reference images to ensure that the scales had the right curvature and thickness.


I sculpted the dragon in a neutral pose, with its wings outstretched and its head held high. This allowed me to focus on the details of the body and scales without having to worry about the deformation of the model during animation.


I manually retopologised the model to create a clean, game-ready mesh that would deform well during animation, but still had the scales modelled individually where needed to capture their silhouette and details.


I also created a higher-poly version of the muscles to use for baking information and future muscle simulation, which I planned to implement later in the project to add more realism to the dragon's movement and deformation.

## Rigging
I rigged the dragon first in Blender using Auto Rig Pro, and set up the bone chains for IK
I also added bones inside the wing's sails to control droop and flutter. 


I also added constraints for the muscles using X-Muscle to allow them to deform properly with motion. 

## Challenges

Within the start of this project, a few challenges that I faced were:
- Maintaining texel density whilst ensuring ease for texturing. so in the end I used 8 UDIM tiles with everything having uniform texel density apart from the wings, which I scaled and then used a static scale to ensure all shader effects were uniform between the two areas. 
- Ensuring there's no clipping of the wings when deforming the sails in the rig. to fix this, I painted the weights from above using pass through mode so every vertex got deformed the same and can't clip. 
- Control Rig, at the start I used control rig instead of modular control rig, however I found that the modular approach suited my needs better as a lot of the rig was mirrored and the IK chains were really useful. 


## Shaders
I started off this project using Substrate as an exploration into the new system and how far you can push its fidelity. 
I wanted to add a "fake" depth to the material which would show the crystalline structure of the sapphire and have it
not just on the surface, but on the muscles and bones too. 
I baked from high to low using Marmoset Toolbag, and also baked a depth map from the muscles to low and the bones to low, which I can use for extra shader effects. 
I created a base texture using Substance Painter and the baked maps from Marmoset, it features surface colour variation, as well as ORM (Occlusion, Roughness, Metallic).

To get the shattered stained glass effect, I created a material in Substance Designer, which utilised a point cloud to scatter points over the wing mask using a gradient created by placed curves over each of the sails to get the size gradient. 
I then got the distance between each point to created my own voronoi but with gradiented size. I smoothed out this voronoi slightly and then used each of the cells with a flood fill to generate a colour map for these cells. 


I also created several masks to use in the shader, such as the wing mask and translucency mask. 

I brought those base textures into Unreal, and set them up as virtual textures, then I used the cells mask from Designer to add refraction to those cells, which allowed the coloured stained glass effect through the wing membrane.
