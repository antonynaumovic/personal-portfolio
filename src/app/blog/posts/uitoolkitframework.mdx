## Concept
I developed a comprehensive UI Toolkit Framework using Unity's <Hi>UI Toolkit</Hi> to streamline the creation of
scalable and maintainable user interfaces for various projects.
This framework leverages the power of UI Toolkit's Block Element Modifier (BEM) and
USS styling to provide a flexible and efficient way to build UIs.

I focused on creating reusable components, consistent styling, and a modular architecture
that allows for easy customisation and extension.

It uses concepts similar to popular web development frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS,
but is tailored specifically for Unity's UI Toolkit. It implements utility classes to facilitate
rapid UI development and ensure a consistent look and feel across different screens and devices.

It also includes a set of text and container spacing utilities to help maintain visual hierarchy
and readability. The text and container spacing utilities provide predefined classes for margins,
padding, and font sizes, making it easy to apply consistent spacing throughout the UI.
It is based off of the same principles as <ExternalLink href="https://www.chainlift.io/liftkit" title="LiftKit" alt="LiftKit Link" />,
a web framework for hierarchical UI spacing and layout design. The framework utilises a phi-based
scaling system to ensure harmonious and visually appealing spacing ratios. 

## Usage
The <Hi>UI Toolkit</Hi> Framework can be easily integrated into <Hi>Unity</Hi> projects by importing the framework package.
Developers can then use the provided USS classes and components to build UIs quickly and efficiently.

There are utility classes for common UI elements such as buttons, input fields, cards, and modals,
as well as layout components like grids and flex containers. The framework also includes support for theming through
BEM modifiers, allowing developers to create custom themes that can be applied consistently across the UI.


## Figma to Unity Workflow
To facilitate the design-to-development workflow, <Hi>Figma</Hi> can be set up to utilise the same 
underlying maths principles as the <Hi>UI Toolkit</Hi> Framework. The base of the system is built off of
the medium text size, which is set to 14px by default. From there, all other text sizes and spacing
are derived using a scaling factor based on the golden ratio (approximately 1.618). This ensures that all elements maintain a harmonious relationship
with each other, creating a visually appealing and balanced design. 
To get the smaller sizes, you divide the previous element by phi,
so for medium to small, it's 14 / 1.618 = ~8.66px (rounded to 9px).
For larger sizes, you multiply by phi,
so medium to large is 14 * 1.618 = ~22.65px (rounded to 23px), and so on.



## Tools
- **Unity** - Game engine used to develop the UI Toolkit Framework.
- **UI Toolkit** - Unity's UI framework for building user interfaces.
- **Figma** - Design tool used to create UI designs and prototypes.

## Outcome
The <Hi>UI Toolkit</Hi> Framework has been successfully implemented in [Leviathan](/work/leviathan "Leviathan write-up"),
providing a robust and flexible solution for building user interfaces in <Hi>Unity</Hi>.
It has significantly improved the efficiency of UI development and helped me rapidly prototype and iterate on UI designs.
