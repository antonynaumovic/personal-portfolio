# Overview
As the lead UX/UI designer and front-end developer for Conectado,
I was responsible for designing and building an online learning platform aimed at providing
accessible education to disadvantaged students.
The platform was developed to facilitate remote learning through interactive course materials,
virtual classrooms, and accessible workspaces.
## Key achievements
- **Visual Design**: Crafted a cohesive visual style that represented the brand identity and appealed to both students and educators.
- **Admin tools**: Helped engineer a suite of administrative tools for educators to ensure the safety of students and the integrity of the learning environment.
- **Web Development**: Developed the front-end components of the platform to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Tools
- **Adobe XD** For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **React** For building the website, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Unreal Engine 5** For developing immersive and interactive 3D learning environments.

# Conectado Case Study

## The users
Conectado serves two primary user groups: students seeking accessible and engaging online education, and teachers looking for effective tools to deliver lessons and manage their classrooms remotely.
The platform is designed to accommodate diverse learning styles and needs, ensuring that both students and teachers can interact with the system intuitively and efficiently.
Primarily, the users are at the end of high school, and university level, but the platform is also adaptable for adult education and professional development courses.

## The product
Conectado is an online learning platform designed to bridge the gap in education accessibility, through technology.
The platform offers a range of features tailored to enhance the learning experience for students and provide robust tools for educators.
Key features include:
- **Interactive Course Materials**: Multimedia content including videos, quizzes, and interactive courses to engage students.
- **Virtual Classrooms**: Real-time video conferencing and collaboration tools to facilitate live lessons and discussions.
- **Accessible Workspaces**: Customizable learning environments that cater to different learning styles and needs.
- **Administrative Tools**: Features for teachers to manage classes, track student progress, and ensure a safe learning environment.


## The business goals
The primary business goals for Conectado were to create a scalable and user-friendly platform that could attract a broad user base of students and educators.
By providing high-quality educational resources and tools, the platform aimed to establish itself as a leading solution in the online education market.
Additionally, the platform sought to generate revenue through subscription models, partnerships with educational institutions, and premium content offerings.


## What do students and teachers need?
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Both students and teachers require an intuitive platform that is easy to
navigate and use.
- **Reliable Communication Tools**: Effective tools for real-time interaction and collaboration are essential for virtual
classrooms.
- **Administrative Support**: Teachers need robust tools to manage their classes, track student progress,
and ensure a safe learning environment.

### Research & Discovery
I analysed existing online learning platforms to identify strengths, weaknesses, and good design patterns, gathering insights from user reviews and feedback.
I also conducted interviews with educators and students to understand their specific needs and pain points in online learning.
I had the opportunity to speak with several teachers and students who would be using the platform,
and taught a number of classes on 3D modelling, which provided valuable insights into the needs of both user groups.

## Wireframes & Prototypes
I created wireframes and interactive prototypes using Adobe XD to visualize the platform's layout and user flows.
These prototypes were tested with internal QA and select users to gather feedback and refine the design.

## Visual Design
Conectado's visual design was crafted to be engaging and accessible, with a focus on clarity and ease of use.
I developed a "spectrum" color palette, typography, and iconography that aligns with the brand identity and
represents the core pillar of accessible education for all people, like the colours on the spectrum.
The founder of the platform also wanted the colour scheme to have classic Latin colours to represent 
its cultural roots.

Since Conectado is built to be used through pixel streaming in Unreal Engine 5,
I designed the UI to be clean and simple, 
without overly complex elements that could be hard to use on higher latency connections.
The text is large and clear to ensure readability across various devices and screen sizes.

## Testing & Iteration
I conducted usability testing with both students, teachers, and internal QA
to evaluate the platform's ease of use and identify areas for improvement.

### What could be improved?
In user testing, some users found the avatar selection to be confusing initially,
causing delays in starting their sessions.
To address this, I refined the avatar selection process by adding clearer instructions and visual cues,
making it more intuitive for users to choose their avatars quickly.

The virtual classroom interface also received feedback regarding navigation difficulties from teachers,
and there were edge cases where teachers could lock their interface without knowing how to unlock it.
To resolve this, I redesigned the navigation layout to be more straightforward and added a helper tooltip system
that notifies users of locked features and provides guidance on how to unlock them.

As well, some students reported challenges in reading control keybinds on smaller screen sizes.
To improve this, I increased the font size of keybind labels and simulated various screen sizes during testing
to ensure readability across all devices.


### What worked well?
The live web-wall feature was particularly well-received by both students and teachers.
This feature allows teachers to share their work in real-time during virtual classes, play videos,
or display any relevant content to enhance the learning experience.
Students appreciated the welcoming feel of the platform, noting that the design made them feel comfortable and engaged in their learning environment.

## Challenges
A big challenge that occured during the project was one incident where we had
advised the management team about adding more admin and safeguarding features,
yet they decided to push forward without them. This led to a situation where a "bad actor"
exploited the lack of safeguards to disrupt classes, causing distress among students and teachers.
This incident highlighted the critical importance of robust safeguarding measures in
online learning environments, leading to us being allowed to implement comprehensive admin tools, audit logging, and incident tracking.

Another challenge was ensuring the platform performed well across various devices and internet connection speeds.
Unreal Engine 5 is a powerful tool, but running many instances of it through pixel streaming can be resource-intensive.
To address this, I immplemented mixed lighting, where static elements used baked lighting,
and dynamic elements used real-time lighting, to optimize performance without sacrificing visual quality.
This is had the added benefit of allowing coloured shadows which was a common theme throught the platform design.

## Where to next?
Conectado has laid a strong foundation for accessible online education, but there are several avenues for future development and enhancement.
Potential next steps include:
- **Mobile Optimization**: Creating a mobile app version of the platform to allow for local running on smartphones and tablets, while reducing server costs.
- **Expanded Sub-campuses**: Developing additional themed virtual campuses to cater to different institutions and allow for an increased revenue stream.
- **Enhanced Interactive Features**: Introducing more interactive elements such as gamified learning modules and AI-driven personalized learning paths to further engage students.
- **Community Building**: Implementing forums and social features to foster a sense of community among students and educators using the platform.

## Outcome
The Conectado platform successfully launched into its initial phase, providing an accessible and engaging online learning environment for students and educators.
The platform received positive feedback for its user-friendly design and effective educational tools.
The implementation of robust admin and safeguarding features has been crucial in maintaining a safe learning space.
