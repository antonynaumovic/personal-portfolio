## What I Did

During my time at Interactive Schools, I contributed to the design and development of bespoke websites for various educational institutions. 
My role involved collaborating with designers and developers to help create web, social media, and print assets that aligned with each school's unique brand identity.

Within my internship, I learned valuable skills in web development, user experience design, and accessibility best practices. 
I gained hands-on experience with the Adobe Creative Suite, and I became proficient in using tools like Adobe XD for design collaboration.

At the time, I helped redesign the templates for the schools' newsletters and social posts in Adobe XD, rather than Photoshop, 
so we could use design tokens to rapidly iterate through designs and ensure consistency across all assets.

I also strengthened my skills in After Effects, Photoshop, and Illustrator by creating engaging visual content for the schools' websites and social media platforms. On top of that, I got the opportunity to work on print materials, designing brochures and flyers that effectively communicated the schools' messages to their target audiences.
As well, I helped QA test new website features to ensure they functioned correctly and provided a seamless user experience. 

Additionally, I was taught to use website analytics and heat mapping tools to monitor user behavior and gather insights for improving website performance, this allowed me to write reports and make data-driven recommendations. 
I was also able to use BrowserStack to test the websites on multiple different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

Following my internship, I was offered a part-time role at Interactive Schools, where I continued to contribute to various projects while pursuing my studies.
