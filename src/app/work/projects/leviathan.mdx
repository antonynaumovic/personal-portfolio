# Overview

As Art Lead, I guided the visual direction and UI/UX design of a live-service multiplayer PvPvE shooter.
I led a team of eight artists while building scalable UI systems, designing user flows, and co-conducting user testing to refine player experience.
Alongside creative leadership, I engineered performance-driven solutions in Unity HDRP, from custom shaders and render passes to optimised pipelines, 
ensuring the game was both visually striking and technically robust.

# Leviathan Case Study

## Initial hurdles
The project owner had several visions for the game,
leading to frequent pivots and changes in direction.
Leviathan started life as an arena shooter with the pivot to extraction shooter coming 3 years into the project.
This caused significant rework and delays as systems had to be redesigned to fit the new gameplay style.
Additionally, I had to transform the original heavily stylised art direction into a more realistic-stylised approach to better suit the owner's vision.

## The core pillars
- **Three Factions**: Three distinct factions with unique playstyles and motivations to create a faction loyalty based community.
- **Metric Driven Design**: Leveraging player data and feedback to continuously refine gameplay mechanics and user experience.
- **Dynamic World-Building**: Make sure no two matches feel the same with dynamic events and environmental changes.

## The users
The primary users were competitive and casual gamers who saught an engaging multiplayer extraction shooter experience without the monotony of other extraction titles.

## The product
Leviathan is a live-service multiplayer extraction shooter that aims to be different in a world of grey extraction shooters. 
It combines fast-paced PvPvE gameplay with a rich, immersive world, offering players a unique blend of competitive and 
cooperative experiences.
Its eccentric style and dynamic gameplay mechanics set it apart from traditional extraction shooters, 
providing a fresh take on the genre.

## The business goals
We wanted to build a strong, loyal player base by offering a polished user experience and a dynamic gameplay loop 
that encourages long-term engagement and retention. We aimed to be active in the community to listen for user feedback
and continuously improve the game.

## How may we sway players to choose Leviathan over other extraction shooters?

### Breaking the mould
Through user research and from being active in the PC gaming community, we found that players were looking for something different in the already over-saturated world of extraction shooters.

### Existing product research
I analysed existing extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown, and The Cycle, looking at
user feedback on forums, reviews, and social media to identify pain points and areas for improvement.\
- Tarkov players often cited its steep learning curve and punishing mechanics as barriers to entry.
- Hunt players appreciated its atmosphere but desired more dynamic gameplay elements.
- The Cycle was praised for its unique blend of PvPvE gameplay but faced criticism for its lack of depth and replayability.
- Tarkov's complex inventory system left new players overwhelmed and frustrated, leading to a steep learning curve that deterred casual gamers.


### Our proposal
By offering a unique experience, filled with 3 different factions, 
each with their own playstyles and motivations, 
we could create a dynamic world that felt alive and engaging
A "rising tension" system where different zones within the map would become increasingly
dangerous over time, forcing players to adapt their strategies and creating hotspots for player interaction.
Simplified inventory and looting systems to make it easier for new players to get into the game without feeling overwhelmed.

#### Creating long term engagement
To keep players coming back, we focused on creating a dynamic world that evolves over time.
3 warring factions vie for control, with player actions influencing the balance of power;
this allows players to feel like their actions have a meaningful impact on the game world.
Regular content updates, events, and challenges were planned to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting.


## Tech Art

### Pipeline Tools
To streamline the asset creation process, I developed a suite of pipeline tools using C# and Python that automated repetitive tasks and ensured consistency across the art team.
These tools included:
- **Asset Naming Conventions**: Automated naming conventions to ensure all assets adhered to project standards.
- **Batch Exporting**: Tools to batch export assets from Blender and Substance Painter directly into Unity with the correct settings.
- **Material Setup Scripts**: Scripts to automate the setup of materials in Unity HDRP, ensuring optimal performance and visual fidelity.
- **LOD Generation**: Automated LOD (Level of Detail) generation to optimise performance without sacrificing visual quality.
- **Animation Baking Tools**: Tools to bake animations inside of Unity to transfer attributes from Blender empties to weapons and hands in Unity.

### Custom Shaders
To achieve the desired visual style while maintaining performance, I created several custom shaders in Unity HDRP using Shader Graph and HLSL.
These shaders included:
- **Uber PBR Shader**: A shader that combined realistic lighting with optional effects such as POM (Parallax Occlusion Mapping), triplanar mapping, vertex painting, and RGB masks.
- **First Person Shader**: A custom render pass shader that allows everything in the render layer to render on top of other layers to remove clipping and separate FOVs.
- **Outline Shader**: A shader that added outlines to objects to improve visibility and readability in the game world.
- **Custom Post-Processing Effects**: Developed custom post-processing effects to enhance the overall visual quality and atmosphere of the game.

## UI/UX Design

### UI Tools

- **Unity HDRP**: Game engine and high-definition render pipeline for creating visually rich environments.
- **UI Toolkit**: For building flexible and efficient user interfaces within Unity.
- **Adobe XD**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Figma**: Migrated from Adobe XD for the advanced design token features, and enhanced collaboration capabilities.
- **Blender**: For making 3D models and assets.
- **C#**: For scripting, pipeline tools, and implementing UI functionality within Unity.
- **Jira & Confluence**: For project management and documentation.

#### Initial wireframes
<img src="/images/projects/leviathan/initialmenuwireframes.jpg" alt="Initial Leviathan Menu Concepts" title="Initial Leviathan Menu Concepts" />
This wireframe was developed in the early stages of the project, after the pivot to extraction shooter, 
to visualise the main menu.
It focused on clarity and ease of navigation, 
ensuring players could quickly access key features like matchmaking, inventory, store, metrics, and settings.
Metrics tracking was a core pillar of the game design,
so it was important to have easy access to player stats and performance data right from the main menu.

These wireframes showcase the in-game HUD and inventory system.
The HUD was designed to provide essential information without cluttering the screen,
allowing players to focus on the action while still being aware of their health, ammo, and objectives.
The inventory system was streamlined for quick access to weapons, gear, and consumables,
while also feeling familiar to existing extraction shooter players.

#### First findings
From our initial testing sessions, we found that players appreciated the clean layout and intuitive navigation, 
however, it was too minimalistic and lacked visual appeal. We found that players wanted more visual cues and feedback to show more about their current actions, such as CODAs for exiting the game, and audible alerts.
Players also struggled to find certain features, indicating a need for better visual hierarchy and emphasis on key actions.

#### Priority revisions
Since the initial wireframes were too minimalistic,
I focused the solution ideas on adding additional functionality to the main menu without overwhelming the user.

##### Solution: Tabbed Navigation
Implementing a tabbed navigation system to categorise features like Inventory, Store, and Metrics, this would allow players to quickly switch between sections without feeling lost; it also has the added benefit of allowing different contexts between views allowing players to come back to what they were doing more easily.

#### Providing user familiarity
To ensure players felt comfortable and familiar with the UI,
I researched popular extraction shooters and incorporated familiar design patterns and conventions.
This included using similar iconography, layout structures, and interaction models to reduce the learning curve for new players.
As a long-time FPS player myself, I drew inspiration from games like Battlefield 1, and Valorant for inspiration on HUD design.

### Creating branding consistency
Maintaining a consistent visual identity across all UI elements was crucial for creating an immersive and cohesive player experience.
To achieve this, I developed a comprehensive style guide that outlined typography, color schemes, iconography, and component styles.
This guide served as a reference for the entire art team, ensuring that all UI assets adhered to the established branding guidelines.

### Next steps
- More user testing sessions to validate the revised designs and gather feedback for further refinements.
- Iterate further on the audio-visual feedback systems to enhance player awareness and engagement.
- Implement user onboarding tutorials to help new players navigate the UI and understand key features.
### Engine and Pipeline enhancements
To support the evolving UI design and ensure optimal performance,
I created a custom UI component framework using Unity's UI Toolkit.
This framework allowed for rapid prototyping and iteration of UI elements, 
enabling me to quickly test and refine designs based on player and internal feedback.

It adds utility classes similar to popular web frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap,
providing pre-defined styles and behaviors for common UI components such as buttons, text, and panels.
As well, it includes phi-based layout spacing classes to help create visually appealing and balanced layouts,
as it spaces items based upon their hierarchical importance and connection to other elements.
This approach not only streamlined the development process but also ensured consistency across all UI elements.

Read more about the framework[here](/blog/uitoolkitframework "UI Toolkit framework write-up").
#### UI Toolkit migration
This project started off using Unity's legacy UI system (uGUI),
but as UI Toolkit matured, I made the decision to migrate the entire UI to UI Toolkit.
This transition allowed us to take advantage of UI Toolkit's modern features and more web-dev like workflow.
I developed a migration plan that involved gradually replacing uGUI components with UI Toolkit equivalents,
starting with less complex screens and working up to more intricate ones to allow for developer ramp up time.
This phased approach minimized disruption to the development process and allowed for continuous testing and feedback.

#### Adobe XD to Figma
Initially, all UI designs were created in Adobe XD.
However, as the project progressed, I identified several limitations with Adobe XD, 
particularly in terms of collaboration and design token management.
To address these challenges, I made the decision to migrate our design assets from Adobe XD to Figma.
Figma's robust design token features allowed us to create a more systematic approach to managing colors,
typography, and component styles.
This ensured consistency across all UI elements and made it easier to implement design changes
across the board.

## End results
Within the final year of development, Nathan Poljak joined the team as a UI Artist to help polish the UI assets.
Nathan and I worked closely to finalise the UI components, ensuring they were visually appealing and functionally robust.
I conducted several rounds of user testing to gather feedback and iterated on the designs based on player input.
I implemented the final UI components into Unity using UI Toolkit, and my component framework to streamline development and allow for easier adaptation from the Figma designs.

Here's a selection of the final UI designs implemented in Leviathan:

## Reflections
This project was a significant learning experience in balancing creative vision with technical constraints.
Leading a team of artists while also being hands-on with UI design and implementation allowed me to develop a
holistic understanding of the game development process.
The challenges of frequent pivots and changes in direction taught me the importance of adaptability
and effective communication.


## Where to next?
Sadly, due to funding cuts, the project was cancelled before release.
However, the experience and skills I gained from this project have been invaluable,
and I look forward to applying them to future game development endeavours.
